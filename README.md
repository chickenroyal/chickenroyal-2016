Current version of my website. Uses a Service Worker to cache the most important files, so it'll work offline.

## Tools

I built the site using the following tools:

* Atom
* Gulp
* Photoshop
* IcoMoon App and Font Awesome

## Acknowledgments

This was my first time using Service Workers. The following websites were invaluable in getting to grips with them:

* [The offline cookbook](https://jakearchibald.com/2014/offline-cookbook/) - Jake Archibald
* [Service Worker Cookbook](https://serviceworke.rs/) - Mozilla
* [Making a Service Worker](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/02/making-a-service-worker/) - Lyza Gardner
* [Service Worker](https://ponyfoo.com/articles/serviceworker-revolution) - Nicol√°s Bevacqua
